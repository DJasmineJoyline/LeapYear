# LeapYear
LEAP YEAR OR NOT Leap Year or not In the Mini project next module is to check whether a given year is leap year or not. Rita allotted this function to Johnny. Rita gave a hint about leap year conditions to Johnny.  Hint: In general terms the algorithm for calculating a leap year is as follows... A year will be a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100. If a year is divisible by 4 and by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400. Thus years such as 1996, 1992, 1988 and so on are leap years because they are divisible by 4 but not by 100. For century years, the 400 rule is important. Thus, century years 1900, 1800 and 1700 while all still divisible by 4 are also exactly divisible by 100. As they are not further divisible by 400, they are not leap years. Help Johnny to write a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not?  Function Specification: int leapyear(int year); The function returns 1 if it is leap year, else it returns 0.    Input Format:  Input consists of a single integer.     Output Format:  Output consists of a single line. Refer sample input and output for formatting details.     Sample Input 1:  1988  Sample Output 1:  1988 is a leap year     Sample Input 2:  1994  Sample Output 2:  1994 is not a leap year      Function Definitions:  int leapyear (int)
